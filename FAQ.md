# FAQ #

## Organization and Administration ##
### Is the lecture in English or German?
English
### Can you get credit for this course during the bachelor media informatics program?
Unfortunately not. However, if you feel comfortable with a little extra work, you can attend the course now and - if you pass the exam - get credit for it later during your masters (only at LMU).

### Whom should I contact with my questions?
Please contact the teaching assistants (Nadja and Tobi) or any of the tutors (Thomas and Florian). If it's a question that could be relevant for other students, please ask it on our Slack Channel. If the teaching assistants weren't able to solve your problem, you can consider contacting Prof. Hussmann.

## Tutorials
### Are the tutorials and assignments mandatory?
No, but you should really (really!) do the assignments to be prepared for the exam. If you submit your solution to UniWorX  (or contribute here on GitHub), you'll get valuable constructive feedback. 

### Will I get bonus points?
Nope, we don't think this is the right approach to motivate you to learn things.

### Are there example solutions?
No, but if you look around on GitHub, you'll find the solutions that other students had created in previous semesters. 
The solutions are most likely not perfect, but ours aren't either! 

### What are the CodeLabs?
CodeLabs are sessions dedicated to coding. We offer a space to work on the assignments. There's always an instructor 
whom you can ask and who will help you if you get stuck with solving a problem. This has worked really well in previous years.

You don't have to sign up, you just show up and raise your hand if you have a question.

### There aren't any free spots for my preferred tutorial date. What now?
Only because it says on UniWorX that there aren't any free spots, this doesn't mean that everybody who signed up will 
actually show up. 

So, just go there and see if you find a seat. If all seats are taken and this is a permanent situation, please talk to
us.

## Exam
### When is the exam going to take place?
We'll announce this ASAP.

### What's going to be part of the exam?
The material of the lecture and all material of the tutorials is relevant for the exam. You can expect to do some
basic code exercises on paper. 

### What kind of aides are allowed?
Basically anything non-electronic, e.g. printed slides, printed code, cheat-sheets, books. We found in previous years
that it's definitely not enough to just print everything and expect to pass the exam. 

### Can I void the exam ("entwerten")?
No, this won't be possible. If you're not prepared, please take the retry exam. If you're successfully registered, and
don't have medical condition keeping you from participating, you are expected to show up. If you don't this will count
as valid attempt and will be graded with a "fail". 

### What happens if I get sick at the day of the exam? 
Don't panic. Please see a doctor and get an attestation that clearly states that you cannot participate in the exam
for medical reasons. You can participate in the retry exam about 2-3 months later.
